# TechJacker
Command line bypasser compatible with chrome os. Bypass AV. Bypass GoGuardian. Bypass Extentions. Possible new 0S and BF0S3R

# What is this used for?

This is a complex PAID and FREE backend for unblocking game websites. We use the ZADMIN Proxy and exploit the about:blank chrome page to make the website of origin unblockable unless shared. 

# What are my plans?

I am gonna make a games website, change the URL everyday and make it paid. 

# How long will this take? 

About a month if I keep the motiviation up.

# Commands
```
help - Lists the possible commands
ping - pings techjacker server
panic - shuts down the website and makes it "educational". (Will also be able to change the URL on specific sites.)
mask - forces all users to be in about:blank mode.
jumpscare - Jumpscares the ONLINE users

exit - Stop running the website.
rs - restarts website
```
